# Food-Beverage-Survey

Performed end-to-end survey analytics for the CodeX energy-drink study: prepared and joined the three survey tables (respondents, cities, responses), cleaned & validated the data, ran exploratory and demographic analyses, produced consumer-preference and competitor insights, and delivered actionable recommendations for marketing/product teams. 

🌟 CodeX:
    CodeX is a German beverage company which is recently launched in India. They launched their energy drink in 10 cities in India.

CodeX conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents.
The survey was based on consumer behaviour questions like their purchasing habits, their feedback about energy drinks available in the market, pricing, packaging etc.
The survey question file is attached at the end of this article.

Their Marketing Team wants Data Analyst's to convert these survey results to meaningful insights which the team can use to drive actions.
The Marketing Team have asked to share certain insights. They have also asked to share meaningful recommendations from the data or external factors etc.

🌟 Tasks I performed:
   My role was to analyze survey data from 10,000 participants and extract meaningful insights. This helped CodeX make informed marketing decisions, increase brand awareness, and enhance product development.

➡️ Task – 1
    I downloaded and opened the dataset in the given format i.e. .csv file. This helped me get familiar with Data. One by one I went through each file to make sure if there was any visual error I could spot.

➡️Task – 2
   I added all the data in  Power BI and created some common Measures like total responses, average taste experience, gender count etc. I performed 1 extra step here and created a new Excel sheet of count of        respondents city-wise. This is because I was practising on MySQL and I just exported a sheet from there and added it to Power BI.

➡️Task – 3
   Created a Word file and copied the question there and whatever idea came to my mind just started drafting there. This is because I am from a Digital Marketing background and my brain kept suggesting marketing    ideas like influencers, the type of marketing we can use etc.

➡️Task – 4
   Created Visuals and report pages.

➡️Task – 5
  Picked a colour theme to design the dashboard and PPT. I used 2 to 3 color shades of green. This is to keep it simple. The PPT was created in Canva using screenshots of my dashboard. During this phase, I         worked on marketing suggestions. I looked at my Word file and used the ideas that came to my mind while I was working on the project.

  These are the task I performed for finishing the challenge.   

🌟 Approach:
    I utilized SQL Server for conducting Query, Power BI for visual analysis, and Canva for engaging video presentations. With these tools, I discovered key findings to drive our future actions.
